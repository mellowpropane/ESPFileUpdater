## Introduction

The **ESPFileUpdater** library simplifies the process of managing files on your ESP32 and ESP8266 devices. Whether you need to download configuration files or update existing ones, this library provides a straightforward approach. You can focus on building your application while the library handles file management seamlessly.

## Features

- **Easy File Management**: Download and update files from online sources with minimal code.
- **Supports Multiple File Systems**: Works with LittleFS and SPIFFS.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to have a small footprint on your device's resources.
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with both ESP32 and ESP8266 boards.

## Installation

To install the **ESPFileUpdater** library, follow these steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to **Sketch** > **Include Library** > **Manage Libraries**.
3. Search for "ESPFileUpdater".
4. Click on the install button.

Alternatively, you can download the library from [this link](https://github.com/mellowpropane/ESPFileUpdater/releases) and add it manually to your Arduino libraries folder.

## Usage

Using the **ESPFileUpdater** library is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to get you started:

```cpp
#include <ESPFileUpdater.h>

ESPFileUpdater fileUpdater;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  fileUpdater.begin();
  
  if (fileUpdater.downloadFile("http://example.com/file.txt")) {
    Serial.println("File downloaded successfully!");
  } else {
    Serial.println("Failed to download file.");
  }
}

void loop() {
  // Your code here
}
```

This code initializes the library and attempts to download a file from a specified URL. Make sure to replace the URL with your actual file location.

## Supported Platforms

The **ESPFileUpdater** library supports the following platforms:

- ESP32
- ESP8266

You can use this library in your projects with any of these boards.

## Examples

Here are some example scenarios where you might use the **ESPFileUpdater** library:

### Updating Configuration Files

You can host your configuration files online and use this library to update them automatically. This is useful for applications that require frequent updates without needing physical access to the device.

### Downloading Assets

If your project requires assets like images or scripts, you can download them on-the-fly. This allows for dynamic content updates and improved user experiences.

### Backup and Restore

You can implement backup features by downloading important files to your device and later restoring them when needed.
